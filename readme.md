# Predict Cancer-Related Proteins in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks
# Intro
Computational protein function prediction is a very important and actively studied research area. Current
state of the art methods use techniques such as homology modeling (for related proteins), sequence analysis
and weighted and annotated Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks. 

# Dataset
PPI-network is modeled as a graph where each node is a protein and each edge is a physical interaction between two proteins. There are two types of annotation information for each protein 
p in the PPI network. A ’functional annotation’ shows the biological functions of p in the PPI network and
a ’cancer-relatedness annotation’ shows if p is involved in cancer or not. The task of predicting cancer related proteins in PPI networks is trying to predict which of the new proteins are involved in cancer.

Note: Dataset is is not allowed to be published. 

# Task
You are asked to design, implement, and evaluate a strategy for predicting cancer-related proteins in PPI networks. A PPI network as described above is given in a dataset. You will be asked to evaluate your method with one test-set and give your predictions for a second test-set.
